# @filefeed/react

Embedded FileFeed is an SDK wrapper that enables you to seamlessly integrate a secure and intuitive data import experience into your React application. With full customization options for colors, fonts, and logos, you can easily align the import interface with your brand identity.

By using embedded FileFeed, you empower your users with a self-serve and guided import process. The importer handles file parsing, validation, and upload—so your team can focus on building instead of managing CSV errors.

If you're looking for alternative integration methods that fit your business needs, explore our [FileFeed Flows](https://docs.filefeed.io/quickstart).
